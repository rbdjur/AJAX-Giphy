Ajax Activity.

The purpose of this activity is to call upon the gif API through this webpage I created. (find the gif website and developers website for proper termminiology).

The objective of this activity is to display and demonstrate:
- how to create buttons by extracting the value typed into a search bar.  
- link a search API to webpage and execute requests.
- Use request data and properly access and pinpoint      relevant data to display gifs.
- With the desired gif data, use functions (click,       reponse) embedded with jQuery for customization of     the webpage html to display gifs of what is typed in   search value.
